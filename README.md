# Federal-Funds-Rate-Analysis

## Overview

We are a data analytics consulting company named Quisitive looking to provide predictive and actionable insights regarding the forward trajectory and absolute level of the Federal Funds Interest Rate using the power of big data. We hope to create a complex time series model that incorporates an Auto Regression and Moving Average order term along with a seasonality and differencing term. We hope to be able to swiftly and effectively achieve forecasted Federal Funds Interest Rate estimates closer to reality than our baseline random walk model.

## Business Problem

The optimization and prediction of interest rates in the economy has long been a hot topic of study within the financial community. Whether it's credit card rates, mortgages rates, US Treasury rates, or Federal Funds Rate (bank to bank overnight lending rate) economists and analysts alike have long yearned for a tool that can accurately and rapidly forecast interest rates into the future. Here, we are focused on the Federal Funds Rate, a rate that is determined by the Federal Reserve and is the foundation of credit markets. Given that the Federal Funds Rate is the shortest term loan, all other longer term interest rates are priced around this metric. We hope to lend our predictive capabilities to key financial institutions and emerging FinTech companies and allow them to accurately price both consumer and interest rate risk. We strive to help these institutions minimize bad debt and reduce credit losses.

## Data Understanding

We are sourcing the data set for this project from the St. Louis Fed FRED Economic Data website, which can be found at ["FRED Federal Funds"](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS). This data set can also be found at Federal_Funds_Rate.csv in the data folder in the Github Repository. We reviewed 610 monthly Fed Funds rate values from July 1, 1971 to April 1, 2022. Limitations of our model includes a narrow timeframe data set, lack of independent variables in the models, and our data points are not mutually independent (time series model problem, each data point is dependent on the value before it).
